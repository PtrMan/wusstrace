WUSSTrace is a user-space syscall tracer for Microsoft Windows developed for fine grained syscall tracing: it supports the majority of Windows system calls (except GUI system calls), the majority of argument types, and dumps faithfully all the supported types. WUSSTrace produces easy-to-parse XML traces leveraging the Boost serialization library. Tracing is performed by injecting a shared library in the address space of the traced process and by hooking the stubs `KiFastSystemCall` and `KiIntSystemCall` in ntdll.dll.
